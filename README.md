# erine.email

*erine.email* is a strong shield for your emails against spam. Based on
unlimited disposable email addresses, *erine.email* is completely free,
open-source, and simple. Really. [Check it out!](https://erine.email).

This repo is the piece of software that you need to host
*erine.email* on your own server.

## Example

Let's say you own the email address **joe@example.org**,
and you created the user **joe** on your *erine.email* instance.

You're about to buy a new vacuum cleaner from **brand42** online shop
and you have to give them your email address.
Communicate them your *erine.email* address instead!

Indeed, emails sent to **brand42.joe@erine.email** will be redirected
automatically to **joe@example.org**. Your personal address is kept private,
and you can disable **brand42.joe** in the future in case **brand42** suddenly
decides to spam you.

## Requirements

A [Debian Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/) with no mail server
running on it.

## Installation

Follow the following steps to install a full working *erine.email* system.

First, get a freshly installed server with **Debian Jessie** as operating system.

Then, as root, update your system, install prerequisites,
and get the Puppet environment:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
apt-get install git puppetmaster puppet
cd /etc/puppet/
test -d environments || mkdir environments
cd environments
git clone https://github.com/mdavranche/erine.email.git production
```

Head to `/etc/puppet/puppet.conf`. In the `[main]` section, tell Puppet agent
who is your Puppet Master:

```ini
server=xxx
```

`xxx` should be your hostname FQDN (that you can get with `hostname -f`).

In the `[master]` section, tell Puppet Master where your environments
are stored:

```ini
environmentpath = /etc/puppet/environments
```

As root, you can setup Puppet agent to run manually:

```bash
kill -TERM `cat /var/run/puppet/agent.pid`
puppet agent --enable
systemctl disable puppet
```

Setup the `iptables` rule to prevent anybody connecting to your Puppet Master.
As root:

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --source 127.0.0.1 --dport 8140 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8140 -j REJECT
apt-get install iptables-persistent
```

Prepare Hiera storage. Hiera will tell Puppet how to configure *erine.email*
software, most importantly **which domain name(s)** will have to be plugged
to your mail server.

Create `/etc/puppet/hiera.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
:backends:
  - yaml
:logger: puppet
:hierarchy:
  - "%{hostname}"
  - common
:yaml:
  :datadir: "/etc/puppetlabs/code/hieradata"
```

Still as root, create directory ``/etc/puppetlabs/code/hieradata/``:

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/code/hieradata/
```

Create the ``/etc/puppetlabs/code/hieradata/`facter hostname`.yaml``
file with your domain names. For example, my domain name is `erine.email`:

```yaml
domainnames:
  - erine.email
```

And reboot.

As root, launch Puppet agent:

```bash
puppet agent --test --environment=production
```

That's it!

Of course, you'll have to set the `MX` DNS record of your domain name to your
server. Make sure you have a result when you dig your domain:

```bash
dig +noall +answer  MX myspameater.example.com.
		59      IN  	MX       	1      smtp.example.com
```

Do not forget to configure the `spf` record either.

## Add your first user

So that your server forwards `something.user@domain` to your real email address,
you'll have to fill the `user` table of the `spameater` database.
At least the `username` and `mailAddress` columns. You can do it manually
with a MySQL client, but the nice way should be to have a website for it
and to read the interesting statistics of the `disposableMailAddress` and
`message` tables (coming soon).

For now, simply run something like the following (replace the VALUES with
what fits you best):

```bash
mysql -u root -p$( cat /root/.mariadb.pwd ) spameater -e "INSERT INTO Users (Username,Email) VALUES('john','mysecretemail@example.com');"
```

## Test that it works!

You created user **John**. Supposing your *erine.email* service is hosted at `myspameater.example.com`,
send a test email to `hotelchainidonttrust.john@myspameater.example.com`,
and it should arrive in your `mysecretemail@example.com` mailbox.

Voil√†.

## Additional configuration

### Reserved users

Note that this part is optional, you do not HAVE to worry about it.

A *reserved user* is a user whose disposable email addresses operates
differently from the `something.user@domain` pattern.
For this user, your server will forward `user@domain` emails to the user's real
email address.
Be careful, for this kind of users, everything
sent to `something.user@domain` will be dropped!

| Email pattern         |  Normal users policy |  Reserved users policy |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| something.user@domain | Forward              | Drop                   |
| user@domain           | Drop                 | Forward                |

A user will be "reserved" if the `reserved` column of the `user` table
is set to 1. The default value is 0 (normal user).

OK, I got it, but what is that for?

The [RFC 2142](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2142.txt) tells that you should
reserve mailbox names for common services, roles and functions. For instance,
the postmaster@domain email address should route emails to a person responsible
for the site's mail system or to a person with responsibility for general site
operation. You also have email addresses like webmaster@domain, abuse@domain...
